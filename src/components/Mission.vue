                <h3>For Those Familiar With Coding</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Classes give you an background in technical concepts; we
                        show you <strong>the technologies at work in people's
                        lives.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While CS classes teach you the botanical science of the
                        digital world, we show you where and how to plant new
                        trees ü¶æüå≥.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We explain the modern languages and libraries that the
                        tech industry uses to accomplish what it accomplishes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plus, we bring in alumni and representatives from real
                        companies to tell you what they think you should know.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We are all <strong>increasingly online</strong>.

                    <li>
                        As the digital world progressively encroaches on the
                        physical one, you probably want to figure out how it
                        works.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But more than that - learning basic programming
                        techniques opens the door to real creativity and a more
                        interesting relationship with interactive technologies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We can help you learn how to code without devoting your
                        life to understanding the logic of a computer.
